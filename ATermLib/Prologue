/ATerms/

  The ATerms provide a generic format for representation and exchange
  of (annotated) terms.

  ATerms were developed in the context of the ASF+SDF Meta-Environment.
  They are also used by the rewriting language Stratego, by the
  transformation tool bundle XT, by the visitor generator JJForester, and
  by numerous other tools developed at CWI, Universiteit Utrecht, and
  elsewhere.

  The ATerm Library (<http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/aterm/>) provides
  implementations of the ATerm Library in C and Java, including numerous
  ATerm command line utilities implemented in C.

/This package/

  This package provides support for ATerms in Haskell. Currently this
  includes the following:

  * Representation of ATerms			("ATermAbstractSyntax")

  * Reading and writing ATerms to\/from Strings  ("ATermReadWrite")

  * Conversion betweens ATerms and user types	("ATermConversion")

  The module "ATermLib" is the top module of the library.

/How to install/

The modules of this library can be used as-is, but if you want to run checks, Hugs and GHC should be on your path.

/How to use/

  1. /Search path/:
       Make sure the src directory is in your Haskell search path.
       For Hugs, this means you should use the -P command line switch.

  2. /Import ATermLib/:
       Import the top level module "ATermLib" into your Haskell program.

  3. /Provide ATermConvertible instances/:
       Provide instances of the 'ATermConvertible' class for all the 
       datatypes that you want to convert to\/from ATerms. You can 
       peek at Test.hs to figure out how.
       Automatic generation of instances is supported by the 
       DrIFT pre-compiler. See below.


/Automatic instance generation/

  The pre-compiler DrIFT can
  be used to generate instances of the ATermConvertible class
  automatically from your datatype definitions.

  1. Get the Strafunski version of DrIFT from 
       <http://www.cs.vu.nl/Strafunski/>.

  2. Add the following DrIFT directive to your file:

     @    {-! global: ATermConvertible !-} @

  3. Import the Haskell ATermLib into your file:
     
     @    import ATermLib @

  4. Run DrIFT on your file.
     
     @    DrIFT YourFile.hs.src > YourFile.hs @
