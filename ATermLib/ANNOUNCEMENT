Release 1.2 of the Haskell ATerm Library is now available from:

  http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/haterm/

This package provides support for ATerms in Haskell. Currently this
includes the following:

  * Representation of ATerms (no sharing).
  * Reading and writing ATerms to/from Strings, either in plain
    textual format (TXT), or in maximally shared textual format (TAF).
  * Conversion betweens ATerms and user types.

To enable the latter feature, you need to provide instances of the
ATermConvertible class for all the datatypes that you want to convert
to/from ATerms. Automatic generation of instances is supported by the 
DrIFT-Strafunski pre-compiler (version 1.4 and upward), which is 
available from:

  http://www.cs.vu.nl/Strafunski/

(We hope that soon jDrIFT will make this version of DrIFT redundant.)
For details on how to use and install these packages, see the README
and example files in the respective distributions.

ATerms
------

  The ATerms provide a generic format for representation and exchange
  of (annotated) terms.

  The ATerm Library (http://www.cwi.nl/projects/MetaEnv/aterm/)
  provides implementations of the ATerm Library in C and Java,
  including numerous ATerm command line utilities implemented in C.

  ATerms were developed in the context of the ASF+SDF
  Meta-Environment. They are also used by the rewriting language
  Stratego, by the transformation tool bundle XT, by the visitor
  generator JJForester, and by numerous other tools developed at CWI,
  Universiteit Utrecht, and elsewhere.

Contributions
-------------

  The Haskell ATerm Library was initiated by Joost Visser.
  Improvement were contributed by Klaus Luettich.
