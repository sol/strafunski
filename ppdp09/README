Slides and paper available online also here:

These are sources that I release with my PPDP 2009 invited talk.
Please understand that this is *illustrative* code.
I have merely sketched certain aspects.
It is really just illustration for a talk!
It may be useful though.

Here is quick inventory of this file system:

pdf: Slides and paper of the underlying talk

shared: basic lib functionality used by several "experiments"
 * holp: higher-order logic programming convenience
 * syb: very little to be shared of SYB among experiments
 * lists: (mainly higher-order) list processing
 * meta: metaprogramming convenience
 * vars: operations on lists/sets of logical/nonground variables
 * msft: test data

experiments: experiments or illustrations used in the talk
 * basic: the most basic SYB experiment
 * backtracking: illustration of backtracking traversal
 * nonground: illustration of traversal of nonground terms
 * bidirectional: crazy inquiry into multi-mode traversal
 * optimized: a generative and optimized model of SYB

All the experiments consist of two parts:
 * lib: all library (generic) functionality
 * app: specific illustrations (using msft typically)
