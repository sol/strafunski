This a pure source distribution of Strafunski's StrategyLib.

Everything should work out of the box.

You can use the library if you have hugs or ghc installed.  If you
want to generate Term instances for Datatypes, you will need
DrIFT. For the examples included in the distribution, the generated
files are however shipped, so that you don't need DrIFT if you just
want to play with distribution.

The distribution was tested with the following configuration:

- ghci/ghc 6.2
- ghci/ghc 6.0.1 (works too but not eariler versions)
- hugs version November 2002 (don't use earlier versions)
- DrIFT 2.0.1 (don't use earlier versions)
- gmake 3.79.1 (most versions should do)
- examples/twosorts-deriving needs an unreleased GHC version

All these programs are expected to be in your path.

Run "gmake check" to test the distribution if you like. There are also
more specific targets for running examples. For example, the most
simple example, i.e., "twosorts-drift-default" is ran with hugs as
follows:

> cd examples/twosorts-drift-default
> gmake test-hugs

For all other information see the file README.
