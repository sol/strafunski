Changes in StrategyLib version 5.0

- Upgraded to GHC 6.4.1, which involved:
  - importing qualified modules from hierarchical libraries
  - adapting to renamings in Data.Dynamics

Changes in StrategyLib version 4.0

- moved Strafunski to sourceforge.
- examples of using class Data see examples/twosorts-deriving
- eliminated use of configuration, automake etc.
- for makerules see subdir "scripts"
- everything works fine with John Meacham's DrIFT 2.0.1
- removed src/Monads.hs --- too many clashes ...
- removed src/Breadthfirst.hs --- could become an example
- removed src/Xml* for the moment, which was disabled anyway
- some examples did not make it into the new distribution
- added mchoicesTP to interface of StrategyPrimitives next to mchoicesTU
- removed some weird functions from the interface of StrategyPrimitives:
  - unTP          (not very useful in usercode anyway)
  - unTU          (not very useful in usercode anyway)
  - applyOnKidsTU (a bit untyped for certain models)
  - applicable    (not needed in usercode)
  - uniTP, uniTU  (not used anywhere, very expensive)
