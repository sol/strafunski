ANALYSIS and TRANSFORMATION of HASKELL ITSELF

1. HsTransform

   This program performs some simple source-to-source
   transformations on Haskell programs, namely:
   
   o Elimination of "do" expressions, 
     see Haskell Report section 3.14
     
   o Introduction of "newtype" declarations,
     in favour of particular "data" declarations.


2. HsExtract

   This program performs "Application Extraction" for Haskell.
   Given a set of user modules and library modules it extracts
   a set of modules that only contain functions reachable from
   the top level functions of a given Top module.


For both programs, we make use of the Haskell abstract syntax, parser, and
pretty-printer as provided by the library package Language.Haskell.
