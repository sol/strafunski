This module is part of a library of functional strategy combinators,
including combinators for generic traversal. The universal term
representation on which the functional strategy representation relies
is defined in this module. Most users will not be concerned with any
of the entities defined here.

This particular model for term representation is based on a
contribution by John Meacham (john@repetae.net).

-- Changes by Joost Visser:
--   * desugared pattern guards to case expressions
--   * made liberal type annotations more specific
--   * commented-out instances for datatypes unknown to Hugs
--   * added some auxilliary functions 
--   * added instance for String that views strings as basic
--     datatypes, i.e. as having no children

--- The universal term representation type -----------------------------------

-- a TermRep contains a Dynamicized term as well as a (lazily generated) list
-- of all its subchildren, and a constructor function to rebuild modified 
-- terms.

newtype TermRep = TermRep (Dynamic, [TermRep], ([TermRep] -> Dynamic))

--- The term interface -------------------------------------------------------
